### CS541_2048

  In this project I first implement 2048 in Android platform by using Android Studio. I got some problem on touch listener. Every time I use the touch listener my grid matrix got massed up. I tried many different ways try to solve it. It cost me a long long time.
  
  Then I implenment the 2048 game by using unity and C#. I added some cool animation when you moving arround the blocks. Too bad I cannot show this on the screenshot.
